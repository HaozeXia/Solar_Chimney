# Solar_Chimney
This project is to explore the influence of the structural dimensions of the solar chimney including length, width, height, angle and heat flux on the flow field, velocity field and temperature field of the solar chimney. This leads to the relationship between the solar chimney structure, heat flux density and natural ventilation.
